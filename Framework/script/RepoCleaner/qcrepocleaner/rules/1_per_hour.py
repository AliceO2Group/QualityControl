    Process this deletion rule on the object. We use the CCDB passed by argument.
    Objects who have been created recently are spared (delay is expressed in minutes).
    This specific policy, 1_per_hour, operates like this : take the first record, 
    delete everything for the next hour, find the next one, extend validity of the 
    previous record to match the next one, loop.

    :param ccdb: the ccdb in which objects are cleaned up.
    :param object_path: path to the object, or pattern, to which a rule will apply.
    :param delay: the grace period during which a new object is never deleted.
    :param from_timestamp: only objects created after this timestamp are considered.
    :param to_timestamp: only objects created before this timestamp are considered.
    :param extra_params: a dictionary containing extra parameters for this rule.
    :return a dictionary with the number of deleted, preserved and updated versions. Total = deleted+preserved.
