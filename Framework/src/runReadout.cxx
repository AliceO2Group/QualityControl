///
/// This is an executable showing how to connect to Readout as external data source. It consists only of a proxy,
/// which can inject the Readout data into DPL. This workflow is intended to be merged with the QC workflow by doing:
/// \code{.sh}
/// o2-qc-run-readout | o2-qc --config json://${QUALITYCONTROL_ROOT}/etc/readout.json
/// \endcode
/// If you do not need to sample data, use the readout-no-sampling.json file instead.
///
/// If you have glfw installed, you should see a window with the workflow visualization and sub-windows for each Data
/// Processor where their logs can be seen. The processing will continue until the main window it is closed. Regardless
/// of glfw being installed or not, in the terminal all the logs will be shown as well.
