/// \brief Collect the list of objects published by all the tasks and make it available to clients.
///
/// The InformationService receives the list of objects published by each task.
/// It keeps a list of all tasks and objects and send it upon request to clients. It also publishes updates when
/// new information comes from the tasks.
///
/// See InformationService.json to know the port where updates are published.
/// See InformationService.json to know the port where to request information for all tasks (param "all") or
/// for a specific task (param "<name_of_task>").
/// See runInformationService.cxx for the steering code.
///
/// Example usage :
///      qcInfoService -c /absolute/path/to/InformationService.json -n information_service
///                    --id information_service --mq-config /absolute/path/to/InformationService.json
///
/// Format of the string coming from the tasks :
///      `task_id:obj0,obj1,obj2`
/// Format of the JSON output for one task or all tasks :
///      See README
///
/// \todo Handle tasks dying and their removal from the cache and the publication of an update (heartbeat ?).
/// \todo Handle tasks sending information that they are disappearing.
