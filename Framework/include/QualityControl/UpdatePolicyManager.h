/**
 * The UpdatePolicyManager is in charge of instantiating and keeping track of policies.
 *
 * Naming:
 *   - a `caller` (e.g. CheckRunner or AggregatorRunner) holds an instance of the UpdatePolicyManager and drives it.
 *   - a `policy` determines whether something is ready to be done or not. It is a  function returning
 *     a boolean.
 *   - an `actor` (e.g. Check or Aggregator) is in charge of executing something when a policy is fulfilled. There
 *     can be several actors for a caller. The actor is not aware of the UpdatePolicyManager.
 *   - the `objects` are received by the caller. They are processed by the actors and their status (e.g. freshly received)
 *     is used by some policies.
 *   - a revision is a number associated to each object to determine when it was received and associated to
 *     each actor to determine when it was last time triggered.
 *
 * The following policies are available:
 *   - OnAny: triggers when an object is received that matches ANY object listed as a data source of the policy.
 *   - OnAnyNonZero: triggers only if all objects have been received at least once, then trigger the same way as onAny.
 *   - onAll: triggers when ALL objects listed as data source of the policy have been updated at least once.
 *   - onEachSeparately: synonym of 'onAny'.
 * If "all" is specified as list of object, or the list is empty, we always trigger.
 *
 * A typical caller code looks like this:
 * \code{.cpp}
 *  // when initializing
 * UpdatePolicyManager.addPolicy("actor1", "OnAny", {"object1"}, false, false);
 *
 *  // in run() loop :
 *  // upon receiving new data, i.e. object1
 *  UpdatePolicyManager.updateObjectRevision("object1");
 *  // check if we should do something
 *  if (UpdatePolicyManager.isReady("object1") {
 *    doSomething();
 *    UpdatePolicyManager.updateActorRevision("actor1");
 *  }
 *
 *  UpdatePolicyManager.updateGlobalRevision();
 *  // end run() loop
 * \endcode
 *
