# The post-processing framework

This framework is intended for planned post-processing of objects generated by QC Tasks, Checks and correlating them with other data. The most common use-cases include correlation and trending of different properties of the detectors.
 
 The users can write their own Post-processing Tasks or use the ones provided by the framework (see [Convenience classes](#convenience-classes)) which are supposed to cover the usual needs. Post-processing Tasks run asynchronously to data-taking, but can be triggered by a set of selected events.  

## Post-processing interface

Any Post-processing Task should inherit PostProcessingInterface, which includes four methods:

  * `configure` (optional) - configures the task, given its name and a configuration interface.
  * `initialize` - initializes the task and its data, given the event which it was triggered by.
  * `update` - updates the task and its data, given the event which it was triggered by.
  * `finalize` - finalizes the processing, given the event which it was triggered by.
  
Interfaces to databases and other services are accesible via `ServiceRegistry`, which is an argument to the last three methods. They are invoked when any of the specified triggers is up, which can be:
 * Start Of Run (SOR)
 * End Of Run (EOR)
 * Start Of Fill (SOF)
 * End Of Fill (EOF)
 * Periodic - triggers when a specified period of time passes 
 * New Object - triggers when an object in QCDB is updated
 * Once - triggers only first time it is checked
 * Always - triggers each time it is checked

Please refer to [`SkeletonPostProcessing`](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/QualityControl/blob/master/Modules/Skeleton/include/Skeleton/SkeletonPostProcessing.h) for a minimal illustration of inheriting the interface, or to [`TrendingTask`](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/QualityControl/blob/master/Framework/include/QualityControl/TrendingTask.h) for a fully functional example. One can generate their own post-processing task by using the `o2-qc-module-configurator` helper, as described in the [Module Creation](ModulesDevelopment.md#module-creation) chapter.

## Configuration

Running the post-processing is configured in a similar manner as it is for QC Tasks and Checks - the configuration parameters are stored in a JSON file or in the Configuration database (at later development stage). The configuration's path should be passed to the application running a task.

This is a snippet of a JSON structure which configures a post-processing task:

```json
{
  "qc": {
    "config": {
      ...
    },
    "postprocessing": {
      "MyPostProcessingTask": {
        "active": "true",
        "className": "o2::quality_control_modules::my_module::MyPPTask",
        "moduleName": "QcMyModule",
        "detectorName": "TST",
        "initTrigger": [
          "SOR"
        ],
        "updateTrigger": [
          "10mins"
        ],
        "stopTrigger": [
          "EOR",
          "10hours"
        ]
      },
      ...
    }
  }
}
```
Each task is identified by its name (`MyPostProcessingTask`). One can activate it by setting the `"active"` field to `"true"`. The task is loaded given its full `"className"` and a `"moduleName"` where it is located. The `"detectorName"` might be used by tasks to store generated data in correct paths in QCDB. The `"initTrigger"`, `"updateTrigger"` and `"stopTrigger"` lists contain triggers which should invoke corresponding interface methods.

### Triggers configuration

Each of the three methods can be invoked by one or more triggers. Below are listed the possible options (case insensitive).

 * `"sor"` or `"startofrun"` - Start Of Run
 * `"eor"` or `"endofrun"` - End Of Run
 * `"sof"` or `"startoffill"` - Start Of Fill
 * `"eof"` or `"endoffill"` - End Of Fill
 * `"<x><sec/min/hour>"` - Periodic - triggers when a specified period of time passes. For example: "5min", "0.001 seconds", "10sec", "2hours".
 * `"newobject:<path>"` - New Object - triggers when an object in QCDB is updated. For example: `"newobject:/qc/TST/QcTask/Example"`
 * `"once"` - Once - triggers only first time it is checked
 * `"always"` - Always - triggers each time it is checked

## Running it

The post-processing tasks can be run by using the `o2-qc-run-postprocessing` application (only for development) or with `o2-qc-run-postprocessing-occ` (both development and production).

To run the basic example, use the command below. The `--config` parameter should point to the configuration file. The `--period` parameter specifies the time interval of checking the specified triggers (in seconds).

```
o2-qc-run-postprocessing --config json://${QUALITYCONTROL_ROOT}/etc/postprocessing.json --name ExamplePostprocessing --period 10
```

As it is configured to invoke each method only `"once"`, you will see it initializing, entering the update method, then finalizing the task and exiting.

This executable also allows to run a Post-processing task in batch mode, i.e. with selected timestamps (see the
 `--timestamps` argument). This way, one can rerun a task over old data, if such a task actually respects given
  timestamps.

To have more control over the state transitions or to run a post-processing task in production, one should use `o2-qc-run-postprocessing-occ`. It is run almost exactly as the previously mentioned application, however one has to use [`peanut`](https://github.com/AliceO2Group/Control/tree/master/occ#single-process-control-with-peanut) to drive its state transitions and push the configuration.

To try it out locally, run the following in the first terminal window (we will try out a different task this time):
```
o2-qc-run-postprocessing-occ --name ExampleTrend --period 10
```
In the logs you will see a port number which listens for RPC commands. Remember it. 
```
no control port configured, defaulting to 47100
no role configured, defaulting to default-role
gRPC server listening on port 47100
```
In the second window, run the following. Use the port number from the output of the QC executable.
```
# If you haven't built it:
# aliBuild build Coconut --defaults o2-dataflow
alienv enter coconut/latest
OCC_CONTROL_PORT=47100 peanut
```
A simple terminal user interface will open, which will allow you to trigger state transitions. Use it to load the configuration by entering the path to the configuration file. The usual transition sequence, which you might want to try out, is CONFIGURE, START, STOP, RESET, EXIT.

# Convenience classes

We aim to provide some convenience classes which should cover the most common post-processing use-cases. Everyone is free to propose extensions to them or write their own tasks for more specific usages taking these as a starting point.

## The TrendingTask class

`TrendingTask` is a post-processing task which uses a TTree to trend objects in the QC database and produce basic plots. The [Post-processing example](QuickStart.md#post-processing-example) in the QuickStart showcases the possibilities of this class.

The following scheme shows how the class is designed. It can access **data sources** which are Monitor Objects and Quality Objects from the Quality Control Database - anything that is generated by other Tasks and Checks. In the future we will also support access to the CCDB.

The objects' characteristics which should be tracked are extracted by **Reductors** - simple plugins. The framework provides a set of Reductors for commonly used data structures, but any custom Reductor might be used as well.

All the values are stored in a **TTree**.Each data source forms a separate branch, with its leaves being the individual values. Additionally added columns include a `time` branch and a `metadata` branch (now consisting only of `runNumber`).

The TTree is stored back to the **QC database** each time it is updated. In addition, the class exposes the [`TTree::Draw`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTTree.html#a73450649dc6e54b5b94516c468523e45) interface, which allows to instantaneously generate **plots** with trends, correlations or histograms that are also sent to the QC database.

### Configuration

As this class is a post-processing task, it inherits also its configuration JSON template. It extends it, though, with two additional lists - `"dataSources"` and `"plots"`:

``` json
{
  "qc": {
    ...
    "postprocessing": {
      "ExampleTrend": {
        "active": "true",
        "className": "o2::quality_control::postprocessing::TrendingTask",
        "moduleName": "QualityControl",
        "detectorName": "TST",
        "dataSources": [],
        "plots": [],
        "initTrigger": [ "once" ],
        "updateTrigger": [ "5 seconds" ],
        "stopTrigger": []
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Data sources are defined by filling the corresponding structure, as in the example below. For the key `"type"` use the value `"repository"` if you access a Monitor Object and `"repository-quality"` if that should be a Quality (this will be unified in the future). The `"names"` array should point to one or more objects under a common `"path"` in the repository. The values of `"reductorName"` and `"moduleName"` should point to a full name of a data Reductor and a library where it is located. One can use the Reductors available in the `Common` module or write their own by inheriting the interface class.

``` json
{
        ...
        "dataSources": [
          {
            "type": "repository",
            "path": "qc/TST/QcTask",
            "names": [ "example" ],
            "reductorName": "o2::quality_control_modules::common::TH1Reductor",
            "moduleName": "QcCommon"
          },
          {
            "type": "repository-quality",
            "path": "qc/checks",
            "names": [ "QcCheck" ],
            "reductorName": "o2::quality_control_modules::common::QualityReductor",
            "moduleName": "QcCommon"
          }
        ],
        ...
}
```

Similarly, plots are defined by adding proper structures to the `"plots"` list, as shown below. The plot will be
 stored under the `"name"` value and it will have the `"title"` value shown on the top. The `"varexp"`, `"selection"` and `"option"` fields correspond to the arguments of the [`TTree::Draw`](https://root.cern/doc/master/classTTree.html#a73450649dc6e54b5b94516c468523e45) method.
Optionally, one can use `"graphError"` to add x and y error bars to a graph, as in the first plot example.
The `"name"` and `"varexp"` are the only compulsory arguments, others can be omitted to reduce configuration files size.
``` json
{
        ...
        "plots": [
          {
            "name": "mean_of_histogram",
            "title": "Mean trend of the example histogram",
            "varexp": "example.mean:time",
            "selection": "",
            "option": "*L",
            "graphErrors": "5:example.stddev"
          },
          {
            "name": "histogram_of_means",
            "title": "Distribution of mean values in the example histogram",
            "varexp": "example.mean",
            "selection": "",
            "option": ""
          },
          {
            "name": "example_quality",
            "title": "Trend of the example histogram's quality",
            "varexp": "QcCheck.name:time",
            "selection": "",
            "option": "*"
          }
        ],
        ...
}
```
